## Description

Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find lost Aircrafts. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area.
This Application will use the Maps to find out the estimated area where an Aircraft would be, and then the search team can use this Map and other details to locate the lost Aircraft.
This application will calculate the location of the lost Aircraft using the various factors like the Last Known Position (LKP), velocity of the Aircraft, direction of the Aircraft and selecting appropriate search patterns.


## 📋 Principle
There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. 
First problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps and find a search area based on Last Known info of aircraft.
Second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible.

## How It Works?

### 1. Report a missing Aircraft : 
Fill the last known information about aircraft like altitude, velocity, coordinates etc.

### 2. Predict the search area :
Identify the probable search area and get realtime information of area for search and rescue strategy.

### 3. Identify most suitable search pattern :
hit and try available algorithm to sweep the search area to find the missing aircraft. 

### 4. Get detailed analysis :
Get the search and rescue operation results with detailed analysis and information.

## Install and Run

## 🎯  Why are we building this ?
Aircraft Disappearance have been happening from the previous century and since then the Aircrafts have gotten better but the number of aircrafts has also increased such that disappearances are still relevant today. The search and rescue operation do not have the tools that make use of mapping and processing technology available.
Finding the crash site in an aircraft disappearance is most of the problem for the search and rescue team. This is where the information about the aircraft is the most valuable resource for the team, And how to allocate their resources according to this information is the crucial decision.
